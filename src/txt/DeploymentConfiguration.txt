1. ALLOW HTTP REQUESTS WITH MANY PARAMETERS

This is a JBoss issue. Metrics are user defined. User can eventually define many metrics that are captured in a single form. In those cases, we can see the following exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: More than the maximum number of request parameters (GET plus POST) for a single request ([512]) were detected. Any parameters beyond this limit have been ignored. To change this limit, set the maxParameterCount attribute on the Connector.
 org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.addParameter(Parameters.java:199)
 ...
 
 In order to fix this, we need tu set up JBoss so it allows more than the predefined number of HTTP parameters in a single request:
 
Jboss 7
Step 1: Open standalone.xml file available in "jboss7\standalone\configuration" folder. **
Step 2: Paste below code after </extensions> tag and change value as per your requirement.

<system-properties>
   <property name="org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT" value="2000"/>
</system-properties>

** Jboss may be using a configuration file other than standalone.xml. For example:  standalone-full.xml, standalone-full-ha.xml or standalone-ha.xml. If, after changing standalone.xml change is not reflected, change any of these other files

Jboss 6 or lower
Step 1: Open standalone.xml file available in "jboss6\standalone\configuration" folder.
Step 2: Find connector tag same as follow and add maxParameterCount attribute.
<connector name="http" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="http" socket-binding="http" maxParameterCount="1000" />
